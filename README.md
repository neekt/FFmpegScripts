# FFmpegScripts
A collection of custom context menu items for the Nemo and Nautilus file managers for handling and editing video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams with FFmpeg.

This is essentially an alpha release, and bugs are to be expected. It should pose absolutely no danger to any of your existing files, but the usual disclaimer about securely backing up all of your files applies.

**Requirements**

These scripts require FFmpeg and Zenity to run. You can install them with:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`

`sudo apt-get install zenity`

You'll also need Montage to generate video thumbnails:

`sudo apt-get install montage`

**How to install**

The simplest way to install these scripts at the moment is to simply download the .zip file and unpack it in `/home/[user]/.local/share/nemo/scripts` (for Nemo) or `/home/[user]/.local/share/nautilus/scripts` (for Nautilus). Once the bugs are ironed out, I will provide instructions for cloning this repo and updating the scripts.

**How to use**

Most of the actions should be fairly self-explanatory, but I will upload some documentation at some point soon.
